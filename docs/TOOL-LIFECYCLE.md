# Workspace tools

Most command-line tools live in the persistent, writable home and are owned
directly by [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), using the baseline in
`config/mise/workspace-tools.toml`.

## Commands

```bash
mise ls          # installed and active tools
mise doctor      # native diagnostics
mise install     # install tools declared by the active configuration
mise self-update --yes
mise upgrade     # update within declared version ranges
codex update     # update only Codex
hash -r
```

Project-specific versions remain owned by each repository through its
`mise.toml`. Prefer `mise exec` in CI and scripts; interactive shells activate
mise from `.bashrc`.

## Ownership

| Owner | Tools | Location | Update |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Persistent home via mise | Node, pnpm, Python, uv, GitHub CLI, chezmoi, Bitwarden CLI, SOPS, age, kubectl, Helm, kustomize, Argo CD, OpenTofu, Ansible, jq, yq, actionlint, Trivy, ripgrep, fd, ShellCheck | `~/.local/share/mise` | `mise install`, `mise upgrade` |
| Persistent home via mise, exact pin | Proxmox MCP server with semantic router | `~/.local/share/mise` | reviewed pin change followed by image build and smoke test |
| Persistent home | Codex | `~/.local/libexec/codex` | automatic before a new session, or `codex update` |
| Image bootstrap | code-server, Bash, Git, SSH, tmux, curl, GnuPG, browser runtime libraries, recovery copy of mise | `/usr`, `/usr/local`, `/opt` | image rebuild and rollout |
| Project | Repository-specific versions | repository `mise.toml` | reviewed repository change |

The image contains a pinned, SHA-256-verified recovery copy of mise. The
launcher copies it to `~/.local/bin/mise` only when the persistent home has no
usable binary. Chromium itself is not bundled; projects own their browser
version and cache while the image provides root-owned runtime libraries.

## Startup and recovery

The entrypoint runs this idempotent native sequence in the persistent home:

```bash
mise install python@3.12.14
mise install node python uv
mise install
codex --version
```

Languages required by npm/pipx backends are installed first. The exact Python
3.12 runtime is installed alongside the floating workspace Python and is used
only by the Proxmox MCP pipx environment. A registry outage does not block
code-server: installed tools remain usable. Retry with `mise install` and
`codex update`.

`proxmox-mcp-server` is an exception to the usual floating interactive-tool
policy because it can receive a cluster-wide administrative token. Its package
version is pinned exactly in `config/mise/workspace-tools.toml`; the `router`
extra keeps the MCP surface to three facade tools instead of publishing the
full domain catalog to Codex. The first routed invocation downloads the
upstream `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5` model into the persistent mise/user cache.
Changing the pin requires source and release review, a successful image smoke
test, and a new immutable producer image. Credentials, Proxmox endpoints and
Codex approval policy remain consumer/operator configuration and never belong
in this repository or image.

The Proxmox MCP pipx environment also pins Python 3.12.14. Python 3.13 and newer
enable strict X.509 verification by default, which rejects legacy CA
certificates without a Key Usage extension. The dedicated interpreter keeps
TLS verification enabled for those Proxmox deployments without downgrading the
workspace-wide Python. Because mise installs are additive, startup detects an
existing Proxmox MCP venv built with another interpreter and force-rebuilds
only that tool. The pipx backend receives the interpreter through its
documented `uvx_args` pass-through because this image uses uv for Python tool
installation. Reissuing a standards-complete Proxmox CA is the long-term
infrastructure alternative; disabling certificate verification is not.

`workspace-doctor` keeps workspace-specific checks and delegates generic
tool-manager diagnostics to `mise doctor`.

## Codex availability-first launcher

Starting `codex` checks for an update when the last successful check is older
than six hours. A failed update keeps an existing binary usable and backs off
for fifteen minutes. A first installation fails only when no binary exists.

```bash
CODEX_AUTO_UPDATE=true
CODEX_AUTO_UPDATE_INTERVAL=21600
CODEX_AUTO_UPDATE_FAILURE_BACKOFF=900
CODEX_AUTO_UPDATE_TIMEOUT=120
```

After a successful standalone installation, the launcher archives a historical
`~/.local/bin/codex` shim so it cannot shadow `/usr/local/bin/codex`.

## Boundary with CI runners

Developer Workspace and CI runners are separate products. The interactive tool
catalog does not justify a custom runner image. CI jobs should use
repository-owned declarations, standard setup actions or package managers
unless a measured technical constraint requires otherwise.
